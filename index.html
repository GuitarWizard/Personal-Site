        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>Again, I'm Steve. I'm an experienced engineer and developer, as well as a licensed patent agent (registration number 76,007). I've worked
        for a few different industries including vocational safety, powersports, transportation and heavy equipment. In addition to my agent license,
        I hold a Bachelor of Science Degree from Minnesota State University Mankato, as well as a Master of Science Mechanical Engineering degree
        from the University of St. Thomas. When I'm not working I enjoy cycling and playing my guitars!</p>

        <h2>My Skills</h2>

            </div>
          <h3>Computational Fluid Dynamics</h3>
          <p class="turbojet-description">One skill I possess is conducing CFD studies for air and particle flow. I've used this skill for my roles in the transportation and heavy
          equipment industries designing air intake systems. I've also done thermodynamic studies on turbojet engine components as part of my Master'degree.
          The programs that I've used to do this include Star CCM+ as well as Ansys.</p>
            <img class="probability" src="Probability_plot.jpg" alt="">
          <h3 class = "Advanced-Statistics-heading">Advanced Statistics</h3>
          <p class = "probability-description">One of my skills from graduate school is statistical analysis. I've used this ability to troubleshoot performance issues with airflow systems
          by evaluating sources of variation. I've also constructed a series of tools for engineering teams to predict chemical filter performance for hydrogen
          fuel cell applications. These were constructed from a series of multiple linear regression models.</p>

          <h3>Project Management</h3>
          <p class = "Project-management-description"> Another area I'm well studied in is project management. I started this in graduate school and have used it professionally for years.
          This skillset includes budget, scope and timeline management, earned value management, and managing project charters and statements of work. Frequently I've combined my knowledge
          of statistics with post mortem project data to construct accurate timelines.</p>

          <h3 class= "astro-heading">Astrophotography</h3>
          <p class = "Astrophotography-description">Another hobby that I've taken up is astrophotography. I specialize in deep space objects. Its a highly technical endeavor but I've gotten
          pretty good at it over a few short years of practice!</p>
